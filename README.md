# Hey there!

I'm [vcokltfre](https://vcokltf.re), a software developer and infrastructure nerd who makes lots of things in Python. I usually make Discord bots using libraries like [disnake](https://github.com/disnakedev/disnake) and [nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord). I also develop libraries of my own sometimes, like [corded](https://github.com/vcokltfre/corded). If I'm not making Discord bots, I'm likely handling infrastructure and moderation for a few Discord servers, or creating APIs in FastAPI. I also like to write technical articles and [tutorials](https://tutorial.vcokltfre.dev), keep an eye out for more of those coming soon!

## Software Stack

- Python (using poetry)
- Postgres (via asyncpg)
