### Hey there!

I'm vcokltfre and I make lots of random things using Python. I usually make Discord bots with discord.py and APIs with FastAPI, although I am working on my own Discord library, [Corded](https://github.com/vcokltfre/Corded)! I spend a lot of my time on the Python Discord server and contributing to their open source projects.

Currently, I'm working most actively on:
 - vcokltfre/tutorial - My discord.py bot tutorial
 - vcokltfre/moot - My social media platform
